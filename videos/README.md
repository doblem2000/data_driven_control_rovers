This folder contains the videos of the experiments deployed to the Robotarium platform. The experiments are named as follows:
- 'robotarium-baseline-ioc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the baseline reconstructed cost in WP4. We can observe that the trajectories are not smooth.
- 'robotarium-proposed-ioc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the proposed cost reconstructed with the proposed features.
- 'robotarium-foc-baseline-no-obs.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the baseline cost. The goal and the obstacles are not displayed.
- 'robotarium-foc-proposed-no-obs.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the proposed cost. The goal and the obstacles are not displayed.
More videos will be added as soon as Robotarium is available again.
